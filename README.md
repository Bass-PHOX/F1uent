# F1uent
Based on [Fluent](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/Fluent) by [Gibbu](https://github.com/Gibbu).
All credit go to them and their contributors. All I did here was edit the font file.
## Installation instructions
I mean, I havent finished the import yet, but if you insist...
### BetterDiscord
> 1) Download and install the fonts provided in the `Fonts` folder. I'm new to CSS and haven't figured out how to host fonts myself yet.
> 2) Right-click [this Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bass-PHOX/F1uent/main/F1uent-beta.theme.css) and select "Save link as".
> 3) Save the file in your themes folder.

### Powercord
No instructions yet! I still have to prepare the files!
